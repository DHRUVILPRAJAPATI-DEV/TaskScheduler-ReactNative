# React Native Task Scheduler

A robust Task Scheduler mobile application built with **Expo** and **TypeScript**. This app allows users to create tasks with priorities, due dates, and notes, automatically sorting and grouping them by their status (Overdue, Today, Tomorrow, Upcoming).

## 📱 Features

* **Task Management:** Create, Edit, Delete, and Mark tasks as Done.
* **Smart Grouping:** Tasks are automatically categorized into *Overdue*, *Today*, *Tomorrow*, and *Upcoming* based on the current time.
* **Advanced Sorting:** Inside groups, tasks are sorted by:
    1.  Completion Status (Active first)
    2.  Priority (1-Highest to 5-Lowest)
    3.  Due Date (Earliest first)
    4.  Alphabetical Title
* **Search:** Real-time filtering of tasks by title.
* **Persistence:** All data is saved locally using AsyncStorage.
* **Clean UI:** Color-coded priorities and responsive layout handling safe areas on modern devices.

## [cite_start]🧠 Sorting & Grouping Logic [cite: 87]

The application uses a custom algorithm located in `src/utils/taskLogic.ts`:

1.  **Grouping:**
    * The app captures the current timestamp (`new Date()`) every minute.
    * Tasks due before "Now" are strictly categorized as **Overdue**.
    * Tasks due the rest of the current calendar day are **Today**.
    * Tasks due the next calendar day are **Tomorrow**.
    * Everything else is **Upcoming**.

2.  **Sorting:**
    Within each group, tasks are sorted using a multi-layer comparator:
    * **Level 1:** Completed tasks are pushed to the bottom.
    * **Level 2:** Higher Priority (lower number, e.g., 1) comes first.
    * **Level 3:** Earlier Due Date comes first.
    * **Level 4:** Alphabetical order by Title.
